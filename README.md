Here, Our aim is to scan vulnerable web-systems for vulnerabilities using ZAP-API service in docker.




## Scan Types

 - Baseline Scan
 - Passive Scan

- Running the Docker Image for Vulnerable web-system , in my case bwapp-docker.

- Docker image of ZAP running on same network for accessing the same ports to attack or scan web-system using different API's with flags supported according to need.
